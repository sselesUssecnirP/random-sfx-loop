# Random SFX üéµ
**Random chaos, one sound at a time.**

**Random SFX** is a lightweight Electron app designed for unpredictable fun, jump scares, ambience, or just background chaos. It automatically finds audio files on your system and plays them at random intervals ‚Äî sometimes layered, sometimes queued, always surprising.

By default, it will:
- Play sounds from `%USERPROFILE%\Music\random-sfx`
- Wait a random amount of time between 0 and *Max Interval* (in seconds)
- Keep going until you hit **Stop**

---

## üéö Features
- **Start / Stop button** to toggle playback  
- **Max Interval** ‚Äì Set the maximum time (in seconds) between random sounds (default = 120)  
- **Master Volume** ‚Äì Adjust all sounds with a global slider (saves automatically)  
- **File Tagging** ‚Äì Use `[song]` or `[sfx]` in filenames for smarter playback  
  - `[song]` ‚Üí always queued, no overlap  
  - `[sfx]` ‚Üí can play anytime  
- **Ignore Untagged** ‚Äì Optionally only play tagged audio  
- **Recursive Folder Search** ‚Äì Finds sounds in all subfolders (with the ability to exclude specific ones)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
- **Change Sounds Directory**  
  Point the app to your desired sound effects folder using an absolute path.  

- **Ignore Directory Folders**  
  Exclude folders from the recursive search by listing them, separated by commas.  
  Example: `clips/edited,audio/edited,videos,notes`  
  This skips any matching folder names under your chosen top-level directory.  

- **Max Running Sounds**  
  Controls how many sounds can actively start at once.  
  - If `ignoreUntagged` is **off**: sounds longer than `minQueueSong` seconds are treated as songs and queued automatically, while shorter sfx can play freely up to the running limit.  
  - If `ignoreUntagged` is **on**: only `[song]`-tagged files are queued, and the app will respect the running limit for those.  

- **Min Queue Song (seconds)**  
  Any sound longer than this threshold is considered a song and will always be queued (unless explicitly tagged `[sfx]`).  
  - Default: `60` seconds  
  - Set to `0` to force *all* sounds into the queue.  

- **Use Audio Tagging**  
  Toggle to respect `[song]` and `[sfx]` tags in filenames. Combine with **Ignore Untagged** for full control.  

- **Master Volume**  
  A global slider controlling overall output volume. Updates in real time and persists between sessions.

## ‚ûï Adding Sounds
1. Navigate to `%USERPROFILE%\Music\random-sfx`  
   (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Music\random-sfx`)  
2. Drop in any `.mp3`, `.ogg`, or `.wav` files  
3. Restart the program to reload your sound library  

---

## üé≤ How It Works
1. Picks a random delay between **0** and your chosen **Max Interval**  
2. Waits that long  
3. Randomly selects a sound from your library  
4. Applies tagging / `minQueueSong` / overlap rules  
5. Plays or queues the sound depending on your settings  
6. Repeats until stopped  

You can keep it light with one sound at a time, allow overlapping chaos, or mix songs and sfx with tagging for a curated kind of randomness.
